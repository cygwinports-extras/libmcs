sdesc: "Configuration settings library (development)"
ldesc: "mcs is a library and set of userland tools which abstract the 
storage of configuration settings away from userland applications. 
Unlike other similar projects, mcs strictly handles abstraction. It does 
not impose any specific data storage requirement, nor is it tied to any 
desktop environment or software suite."
